# Probably Broken

Sometimes you need a spare domain you can mess around with to test something you're building. 

Sometimes you come up with a clever name for such a domain. 

Sometimes you think you're more clever than you are.

In those times [ProbablyBroken.dev](https://probablybroken.dev) is the result. A tribute to, and celebration of, building new things by breaking them.
